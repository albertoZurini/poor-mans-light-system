# Poor man's party light

Do you want to host a party with cool lights, but you don't have enough money (or time) to set up a light system? Well with this new `poor man's party light` you will be able to set up your personal light system using your computer (or even tablet or mobile phone) monitors.

# They all are synced!

Thanks to `socket.io` each client is in sync with the main server so each monitor has the same color and the same transition.

# It can't hear music

Unfortunately this script is too poor to have a mic, so all animations are static and independent from the beat which is playing. Maybe next update will implement microphone compatibility.

# How to use

First of all install `nodejs` and `npm`. Then clone this repository and in the main directory run `npm install`. After `npm` has completed installing all dependencies run `node app.js` and enjoy going to `http://YOURIP:8080` with as many clients as you can.
